    <p>
        Fresh orange juice takes a little work, but it tastes much better than orange juice from <br> concentrate. I came up with this recipe in response to a request about how to make <br> fresh-squeezed orange juice. You may also use a citrus reamer to do this. If you want less pulp, <br> use a hand juicer with a strainer.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            4 oranges
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly smack each orange on the counter. Cut each orange in half and squeeze juice into a <br> glass.
        </li>
    </ol>
