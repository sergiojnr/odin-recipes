    <p>
        Fresh orange juice takes a little work, but it tastes much better than orange juice from <br> concentrate. I came up with this recipe in response to a request about how to make <br> fresh-squeezed orange juice. You may also use a citrus reamer to do this. If you want less pulp, <br> use a hand juicer with a strainer.
